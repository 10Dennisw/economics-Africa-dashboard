# Quick Introduction 
This dashboard visualises economic data from countries. More precisely, the visualisation maps specific wealth through measuring Gross Domestic Product (GDP). GDP is calculating through adding the consumption, investment, net government expenditure and net exports. The dashboard is designed for economists with a background knowledge in the data.

The data is from Kaggle and gathered from the world bank. The data is panel data; therefore, contains the numerous data on different countries over a period. 

The dashboard was created using the Dash and Plotly library.  

The dashboard contains different pages which shows the different aspects of the data.
- Page 1 shows a general overview of the GDP and population in each country, distribution of the total GDP in Africa and Bar Chart. Page 1 contains a slider meaning that the user can view the information over a period.
- Page 2 shows the growth of wealth in Africa, by showing the data in the first and final year. 
- Page 3 shows the specific GDP per capita. This highlights the wealth per individual.
